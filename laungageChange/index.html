            <p class="description">Hello, everyone! This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other
                "longest texts ever" on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here it is! This is going to be a
                WORLD RECORD! This is actually my third attempt at doing this. The first time, I didn't save it. The
                second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it into the
                Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that
                my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty
                long. I hope this one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles
                are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word
                "Waffles" is said a hundred-something times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans Go episode
                about Pig Latin.</p>
